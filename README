So here's an XChat plugin. Pretty simple, just load and use.
The purpose is to ignore any line that starts referring to an
ignored nickname.
Say, if you've got Kyte ignored, "Kyte: blah blah" will get
ignored as well, doesn't matter the origin.

It's only got /ignorelist, mostly for testing, to see what
nicknames're being tracked by the plugin.
Also catches /ignore and /unignore to update the list.

No comments, because this was a favor and I was tired. It
should be pretty self-explanatory, so long as you understand
iterators.
